ROS for LabVIEW(TM) Software
============================

This is a set of VIs for communicating with ROS applications. Developed at Tufts University by the Mechanical Engineering Department and the Center for Engineering Education and Outreach. Currently in beta.

If installing from github: ROSforLV should be installed in your "LabVIEW > user.lib" folder (Under applications in Mac OS X and program files in Windows). LabVIEW will need to restart after installing the library.

ROS for LabVIEW Software can be run on Windows and Mac OS. Linux platforms have not been tested.

Use of ROS for LabVIEW Software with the myRIO requires Windows, LabVIEW 2013 or later, LabVIEW myRIO toolkit, and LabVIEW Real-Time Module.

Use of ROS for LabVIEW Software with the roboRIO requires Windows, LabVIEW 2014 or later, LabVIEW roboRIO toolkit, and LabVIEW Real-Time Module.

If you are running LabVIEW on a Virtual Machine, you may have to change your network settings to Bridge.

Use with Baxter Research Robot
==============================
This package has been developed with the use of Baxter Research Robot. Much of his functionality has already been implemented and can be found in the devices folder.
